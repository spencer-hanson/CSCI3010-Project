# Homework 5 (Final Checkpoint 1)

## Planned features to implement
- Function documentation for
    - funcmap
    - fold_left
    - fold_right
    - compare
    - lt, gt, gte, lte, eq, neq
- Test suite integration using ICS, all currently implemented features
- Test suite integration with GitHub (travis-ci)
- Following editing features, along with ICS (Image Creation Script) equivalents 
    - FlipX
    - FlipY
    - Rotate
    - ColorShift
Will need to write scripts in ICS for each subclass implementation
    - CaseInsensitiveDict
    - PrefixInsensitiveDict
    - SuffixInsensitiveDict
    - FunctionalInsensitiveDict
    - FunctionDictPlus
    - FunctionallyOrderedDictPlus
    - TwoWayDictPlus
    - HookedDictPlus
    - OneWayDictPlus
    - SerializableDictPlus
    - ImmutableDictPlus
    - UniqueDictPlus


***Note: The following are included for the next checkpoint as well***
    
- Will need to write scripts for each function
    - squish
    - expand
    - map
    - remap
    - swap
    - merge
    - drop
    - split
    - multiply
    - divide
    - add
    - sub
    - update, unupdate
    - chop
    - funcmap
    - fold_left
    - fold_right
    - compare
    - lt, gt, gte, lte, eq, neq
- Implementation of the following subclasses (with examples)
    - HookedDictPlus
    - OneWayDictPlus
    - SerializableDictPlus
    - ImmutableDictPlus
    - UniqueDictPlus
    - FunctionallyOrderedDictPlus
    - TwoWayDictPlus


##  What was actually accomplished
Everything, but the tasks for the subclasses was changed to optimize the program with PIL loading,
automated travis tests and test cases

## What is planned for the next deadline
Nothing! Finished all requirements in preparation for finals.
