## Planned features to implement
- Function documentation for
    - funcmap
    - fold_left
    - fold_right
    - compare
    - lt, gt, gte, lte, eq, neq
- Implementation of the following subclasses (with examples)
    - HookedDictPlus
    - OneWayDictPlus
    - SerializableDictPlus
    - ImmutableDictPlus
    - UniqueDictPlus
    - FunctionallyOrderedDictPlus
    - TwoWayDictPlus
- Test suite integration using ICS, all currently implemented features
- Test suite integration with GitHub (travis-ci)
- Following editing features, along with ICS (Image Creation Script) equivalents 
    - FlipX
    - FlipY
    - Rotate
    - ColorShift
    
***Note: The following are included for the next checkpoint as well***

    - swap
    - merge
    - drop
    - split
    - multiply

    - chop
    - funcmap
    - fold_left
    - fold_right
    - compare
    - lt, gt, gte, lte, eq, neq

Will need to write scripts in ICS for each subclass implementation
    - CaseInsensitiveDict
    - PrefixInsensitiveDict
    - SuffixInsensitiveDict
