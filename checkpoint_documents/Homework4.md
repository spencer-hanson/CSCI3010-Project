# Homework 4

## Planned features to implement
- Following editing features, along with ICS (Image Creation Syntax) equivalents 
    - Circle
    - Line
    - Save Image
    - Load Image
    - Drawing functionality with Brush class
- Implementation of the following subclasses (with examples)
    - FunctionDictPlus
- Example function documentation for 
    - split
    - multiply
    - chop
    - divide
    - add
    - sub

##  What was actually accomplished
Everything except TwoWayDictPlus & FunctionallyOrderedDictPlus, as I realized halfway through
that I needed to implement HookedDictPlus before I could implement that, so I worked on polishing the UI more,
along with adding a 'New Image' button

## What is planned for the next deadline
- Function documentation for
    - funcmap
    - fold_left
    - fold_right
    - compare
    - lt, gt, gte, lte, eq, neq
- Implementation of the following subclasses (with examples)
    - HookedDictPlus
    - OneWayDictPlus
    - SerializableDictPlus
    - ImmutableDictPlus
    - UniqueDictPlus
    - ListPlus
    - FunctionallyOrderedDictPlus
    - TwoWayDictPlus
- Test suite integration using ICS, all currently implemented features
- Test suite integration with GitHub (travis-ci)
